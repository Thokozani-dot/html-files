<p>Eating a diet high in fruits can reduce a person's risk of developing heart disease,cancer,inflammation, and diabetes.<br>
citrus fruits and berries may be especially powerful for preventing disease.Any fruit or 100% fruit juice counts as part of the Fruit Group.
 <br>Fruits may be fresh, frozen, canned, or dried/dehydrated, and may be whole, cut-up, pureed, or cooked.
<br> At least half of the recommended amount of fruit should come from whole fruit, rather than 100% fruit juice.
